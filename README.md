## Description

This project was made during class at Epicodus. With this project, you will be able to determine the type of a triangle by entering three numbers in the text fields. Depending on the input, the application will return "equilateral triangle", "scalene triangle", "isosceles triangle", or "not a triangle." Over time this project will be updated to include functionality for identifying other shapes such as curcles and rectangles.
